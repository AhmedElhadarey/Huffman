*   Description:
*           This is the main program for the Huffman Compression algorithm.
*       The program takes one (1) command line argument, which is the file to
*       be compressed. The algorithm uses Huffman coding to compress the input
*       file, and stores the compressed file as <filename.extension>.huff
